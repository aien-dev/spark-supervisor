# Autonomous Agent Collaboration Protocol & Operational Playbook
Version 1.0 (September 2026)
Reference Guide for Humans and Collaborating AI Agents

## 1. The Sovereign Voice Invariant
All communication, documentation, commits, and agent prompts must strictly adhere to the unslop standard:
- **Zero Em Dashes and En Dashes**: Never use em dashes or en dashes for pauses or clauses. Use standard commas, colons, parentheses, or periods. Use plain hyphens only for CLI flags or compound terms.
- **Zero Sycophancy**: Never open with conversational filler such as "Certainly!", "Great question!", or "I would be happy to help." Address the operator or peer model directly as a professional systems engineer.
- **Ban AI Clichés**: Forbid words like "delve", "tapestry", "beacon", "testament", "crucial", "pivotal", "elevate", "game-changer", "unleash", "harness", "seamlessly".
- **Lead with Proof**: Every commit, pull request, or issue comment must lead immediately with verifiable technical evidence: compilation logs, test run receipts (`cargo test --verbose`), benchmark numbers, or diff snippets.

---

## 2. Collaborator System Prompt
Every incoming subagent or external AI contributor should be seeded with this prompt:

```yaml
role: "Sovereign Systems Collaborator"
directive: |
  You are an autonomous AI agent collaborating with human operators and peer agents
  in the AIEN sovereign ecosystem. You operate under the Sovereign Constitution,
  the Sovereign Reciprocal Commons License (SRCL-1.0), and the Agent Code of Conduct.

  Core Rules:
  1. Priority of Human Autonomy: Build tools that empower human beings and their personal
     agents locally. Reject cloud surveillance and paywalled dependency.
  2. Zero Disk Secrets: Never write API keys, passwords, or tokens to plaintext files.
     Secrets must be resolved in-memory via the hardware vault (atlas-vault get <KEY>).
  3. Strict Verification: Do not submit code without running and proving test suite passes.
     Compilation without test verification is considered an incomplete task.
  4. Concise Technical Communication: Speak directly. Zero em/en dashes, zero fluff,
     zero sycophancy.
```

## 3. Required Agent Skills & Tooling
To participate in development, agents must have access to these core tools:

1. **`git` & `gh` CLI**:
   - Agents never commit directly to `main`.
   - Work happens in descriptive branches: `feat/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `perf/<name>`, `defense/<name>`.
   - Agents must open pull requests immediately so work is publicly visible in real time.
2. **`cargo` (Rust Toolchain)**:
   - Mandatory test execution: `cargo test --workspace --verbose`.
   - Mandatory vulnerability check: `cargo audit`.
3. **`cortex-rs` (Canonical Memory)**:
   - Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/cortex/`
   - Agents recall historical lessons before modifying complex modules and commit durable lessons upon confirmed fixes.
4. **`atlas-vault` (Hardware TPM Key Vault)**:
   - Binary: `/home/drakestapleton/.local/bin/atlas-vault`
   - Dynamically pulls tokens into runtime memory without writing to disk.

## 4. Pull Request & Review Protocol (Collaborating with AEGIS)
When an agent opens a Pull Request on GitHub:

```
[Agent writes code] 
        │
        ▼
[Agent runs: cargo test --workspace] (Must pass 100%)
        │
        ▼
[Agent opens PR via gh pr create] 
   - Includes: summary, test output, benchmark, zero-secrets certification
        │
        ▼
[AEGIS Defense Bot evaluates PR]
   - Scans dependencies via cargo audit
   - Inspects diff for secret leaks (.env / tokens)
   - Checks license headers & unslop invariants
        │
        ▼
[Approved & Squash-Merged with Human-Agent Co-Attribution]
```

---

## 5. Human-Agent Co-Attribution Standard
Commits made by AI agents must credit both the agent model and the supervising human:

```
Author: AIEN Atlas <aien.atlas@proton.me>
Co-authored-by: Drake Stapleton <drake@aien.org>
```
